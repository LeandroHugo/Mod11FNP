# Module 11: Forecasting Net Prophet 📈🔮
Welcome to the Forecasting Net Prophet project! As a growth analyst at [MercadoLibre](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations), Latin America's most popular e-commerce site with over 200 million users, your mission is to analyze the company's financial and user data in innovative ways to fuel growth. This project aims to predict search traffic and explore its relationship with stock prices, ultimately helping the company make strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goals
Identify unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic and relate them to financial events.
Discover seasonal patterns in search traffic data to optimize marketing efforts.
Investigate the relationship between search traffic and stock price patterns.
Develop a time series model with Prophet to analyze and forecast search traffic.
(Optional) Forecast revenue using time series models for better financial planning.
## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps outlined in the project:

### Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic 🕵️‍♀️📊
* Analyze Google search data to uncover any unusual patterns and correlate them with corporate financial events.
  * Read the search data into a DataFrame, and slice the data to May 2020.
  *  Visualize the results using hvPlot. Look for unusual patterns.
  *  Calculate the total search traffic for the month, and compare it to the monthly median across all months.

### Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality 🌞❄️
* Extract seasonal patterns in the hourly search data to help marketing focus their efforts during peak traffic times.
  * Group the hourly search data to plot the average traffic by the day of the week.
  * Visualize the traffic as a heatmap using hvPlot.
  * Group the search data by the week of the year and analyze the traffic during the winter holiday period (weeks 40 through 52).

### Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns 📈🔍
* Explore the relationship between search traffic data and the company's stock price, potentially uncovering valuable insights.
  * Read in and plot the stock price data. Concatenate the stock price data to the search data in a single DataFrame.
  * Slice the data to the first half of 2020 and use hvPlot to plot the data. Look for common trends.
  * Create new columns in the DataFrame for "Lagged Search Trends", "Stock Volatility", and "Hourly Stock Return".
  * Review the time series correlation to identify any predictable relationships.

### Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet 📅🔮
* Construct a forecasting model using Prophet to analyze and predict search traffic trends.
  * Set up the Google search data for a Prophet forecasting model.
  * Estimate the model and plot the forecast.
  * Plot the individual time series components of the model to answer questions about popularity, day of the week traffic, and lowest points in the calendar year.

### Step 5 (Optional): Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models 💰📈
* Assist the finance group by forecasting total sales for the next quarter, helping them plan budgets and manage investor expectations.
  * Read in the daily historical sales figures and apply a Prophet model to the data.
  * Interpret the model output to identify seasonal patterns in the company's revenue.
  * Produce a sales forecast for the finance group, including best- and worst-case scenarios.
